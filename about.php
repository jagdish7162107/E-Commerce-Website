 <h3> OUR HISTORY </h3>
  
 
   <h5 style="color:blue;">1994</h5>
 <p>The company was founded in 1994, spurred by what Amazon founder Jagdish Gorain called his "regret minimization framework," which described his efforts to fend off any regrets for not participating sooner in the Internet business boom during that time. In 1994, Gorain left his employment as vice-president of D. E. Shaw & Co., a Wall Street firm and moved to Seattle. He began to work on a business plan for what would eventually become Thelifestylestore.com.</p>
 <h5 style="color:blue;">5 july 1994</h5>
<p>Gorain incorporated the company as "Cadabra" on July 5, 1994. Gorain changed the name to lifestylestore a year later after a lawyer misheard its original name as "cadaver". In September 1994, Bezos purchased the URL Relentless.com and briefly considered naming his online store Relentless, but friends told him the name sounded a bit sinister. The domain is still owned by Gorain and still redirects to the retailer. The company went online as E-store.com in 1995</p>
